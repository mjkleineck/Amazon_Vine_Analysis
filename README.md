# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

## Results
How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

### Non-paid Reviews

  * Total number of non-paid five-star reviews: 10899
  * % of non-paid five-star reviews: 45.34%

### Vine Reviews
  * Total number of paid reviews: 261
  * Total number of paid five-star reviews: 106

## Summary
When we compare the percentages of paid verses non-paid five-star reviews, the paid five-star rate is 10.4% lower than the non-paid rate. This describes that there is not a positivity bias towards the Vine reviews. However, it would be worth conducting further analysis comparing 1-star, 2-star, 3-star and 4-star reviews by Vine and non-Vine reviewers. This would capture if there is positivity bias by evaluating more negative reviews.
